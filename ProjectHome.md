The aim of this project is to make an open home automation system not only targeted adtcontrolling the domotics system inside a house, but also keeping track of contacts, sending automated birthday wishes, automated reminders etc.

The domotics system that this project focusses on is the Domintell system, but adding support for other systems is surprisingly easy.
